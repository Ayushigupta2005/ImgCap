# ImgCap – Visuals That Speak 👁️

## 📌 Overview
**ImgCap** is an intelligent **Image Captioning Framework** that automatically generates natural language descriptions for images.  
It combines **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for visual recognition with **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks for text generation.  

With ImgCap, images are not only seen but also described, making it useful for:
- Accessibility tools
- Social media content labeling
- Content management systems

## ✨ Key Features
- **Automatic Captioning** → Produces descriptive text for any given image.  
- **Context Awareness** → Understands and interprets images in real time.  
- **Pre-Trained Models** → Uses **ResNet50** for feature extraction.  
- **Hybrid Architecture** → CNN handles vision, LSTM generates fluent captions.  
- **Customizable** → Swap models or fine-tune for domain-specific datasets.  
- **Web Interface** → Upload an image and instantly get captions.

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Visual Feature Extraction (CNN Encoder)
- Input image is passed through **ResNet50** (pre-trained on ImageNet).  
- Extracts patterns, shapes, and objects as feature vectors.  
- Uses **transfer learning** to boost performance with less training data.  

### 2️⃣ Language Generation (LSTM Decoder)
- CNN features are fed into an **LSTM network**.  
- LSTM generates captions **word by word**.  
- Learns sentence structure and grammar from paired image–caption datasets.  

### 3️⃣ Dataset & Training
- Trained on the **[Flickr8k dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k)** containing 8,000 images with multiple captions each.  
- Builds mappings between images and text for training.  
- *(Dataset not included in this repo due to size limits).*  

### 4️⃣ Captioning New Images
- CNN extracts visual features.  
- LSTM decodes them into a descriptive caption.  
- Output includes objects, actions, and context.

## 🌐 Web Application
A simple **frontend interface** is included:  
- Upload any image.  
- Backend generates a caption.  
- Caption is displayed instantly on the website.
